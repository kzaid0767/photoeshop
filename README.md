# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Beginnings of an e-commerce store:

### `About the app`

In this project I continued my learning process with ReactJS.
In addition to make use of reusable component I added a few more skills in the process.

### `Extras from React Learned`
UseState, useEffect, useRef, useContext.
Making using custome hooks was a big achievement in this project.
